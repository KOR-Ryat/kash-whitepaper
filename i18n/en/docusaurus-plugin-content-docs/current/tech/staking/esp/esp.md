# Early Staking Pool

This page explains the features of the Early Staking Pool, the first staking pool in the KASH ecosystem. This pool is designed for the purpose of distributing rewards to participants of the initial sales.

:::note
Additional sales are currently planned for around the time of exploration completion. However, the policies for these additional sales, including the reward distribution plan, have not yet been finalized. Therefore, this document is limited to the system details of the first staking pool, the Early Staking Pool, which is specifically for the initial sales.
