# Introduction of Staking

As a core component of the KASH Phase 1 ecosystem, Staking is designed to recognize the contributions of early participants and long-term contributors. It provides additional incentives while encouraging sustainable ecosystem participation over short-term profit-taking.

### Purpose

KASH Staking is designed with two distinct objectives:
1. To provide concrete and substantial rewards to sales participants.
2. To strike a reasonable balance between participants' investment flexibility and the ecosystem's stability in the process.

### Feature

KASH Staking has the following features:

+ **Perpetual Staking**: KASH Staking offers a flexible structure that allows users to freely unstake all or a portion of their funds without a separate lock-up period. Staking rewards are distributed periodically to participants in proportion to their contribution (share of the total staked amount).

+ **Effortless Compounding**: KASH Staking is designed to offer users both profit maximization and convenience. Through a share-based reward distribution system, it provides an automatic compounding effect, equivalent to interest being reinvested without any additional user action.

+ **Expectable Profit**: By limiting the maximum issuable shares in a single staking pool, the dilution of each share's value is prevented. The reward distribution schedule and total amount for the pool are also predetermined, allowing participants to predict the total expected rewards at the time of staking.

+ **Early Participant Bonus**: Early sales participants are granted a semi-permanent bonus within the pool. This allows them to receive additional rewards as if they had staked a larger amount.
