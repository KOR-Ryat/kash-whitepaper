### Gold Price Scenario-Based Outlook and KASH Price Prediction for 2027-2030

Based on future projections of global gold prices, we have constructed two scenarios: **neutral** and **aggressive**.

For each scenario, we assumed **monthly gold prices** from January 2027 to January 2030, and calculated the changes in vRWA(Gold) liquidation volume and remaining vRWA value accordingly.

We also estimated the monthly trends of USDT accumulation in the reserve pool and total asset value, and predicted changes in **KASH token price** by dividing by **100M KASH** (issuance volume of 100 million).

Below, we summarize the basis and results for gold price assumptions in each scenario, and present monthly data in tables.


### Neutral Scenario (Gradual Gold Price Increase)

#### ✅ Assumptions

This is a moderate outlook where gold prices rise gradually. According to some professional institutions' forecasts, gold prices could break through the \$4,000 level by 2027 and approach \$5,000 in 2028-2029.

For example, InvestingHaven projected a rise to \$4,400 by 2027, and famous investor John Paulson also mentioned it could rise to near \$5,000 by 2028. Based on predictions from Gov Capital and others, a scenario of over \$5,200 by the end of 2029 is possible.

#### ✅ Gold Price Levels

This scenario starts at \$3,250 oz in January 2027, steadily rising to about \$4,150 by the end of 2027, \$4,750 by the end of 2028, and \$5,280 by the end of 2029.

We assume it rises slightly further to about \$5,400 by January 2030. This increase represents a scenario where gold prices show a steady upward trend, driven by continued gold purchases by central banks and increased safe-haven demand due to geopolitical uncertainties.

#### 📘 Scenario Results

As gold prices rise, the vRWA collateral value increases significantly, leading the reserve pool's total value to show **overcollateralization** over time.

Initially starting at **\$1.04** per KASH with a reserve pool value of about **\$104M** (overcollateralized) at a gold price of \$3,250 in January 2027. Even as gold sales proceed, the appreciation in remaining gold value is substantial, with the reserve pool's total assets exceeding **\$127M** and KASH price reaching **\$1.27** by the end of 2027.

In 2028, as gold prices rise from mid-\$4,000s to late-\$4,000s, reserve pool assets increase, bringing KASH price to around **\$1.37**.

Finally, when all gold liquidation is completed by the end of 2029, over **\$140M** in USDT will be secured in the reserve pool, with each KASH token's intrinsic value expected to be around **\$1.40**.

In other words, the gold price increase is reflected in KASH's collateral value, resulting in KASH showing **about 40% value appreciation** from its initial value.

### Aggressive Scenario (Sharp Gold Price Increase)

#### ✅ Assumptions

This is an optimistic outlook where gold prices surge in a bull market. Some institutions like JP Morgan project gold could rise to \$6,000 by 2029, and in case of severe inflation, there's even a possibility of it surging beyond \$8,000 by 2030.

For instance, Incrementum's report projected that gold prices could move within a range of **\$4,800 ~ \$8,900** by 2030.

This scenario reflects a situation where gold prices rise sharply, assuming such a **near-maximum bullish phase**.

:::

#### ✅ Gold Price Levels

Starting at \$3,200/oz in January 2027, it soon shows strength, surging to **\$5,000** by the end of 2027, **\$6,000** by the end of 2028, and rising to **\$7,000** by the end of 2029. (While this is somewhat more aggressive than JP Morgan's \$6,000 projection for 2029, it's a possible scenario if the overall gold investment environment is very favorable.)

We assume it rises to \$7,200 by January 2030. This path envisions a **gold bull market** where investment funds flow heavily into gold due to explosive buying increases by central banks, serious geopolitical crises, or currency value depreciation.

#### 📘 Scenario Results

Due to the sharp rise in gold prices, the value of vRWA(Gold) held as collateral increases significantly, greatly expanding reserve pool assets.

Starting from about **\$102.4M** (KASH at \$1.024) in January 2027, the reserve pool's total value, thanks to rising gold prices, breaks through **\$150M** by the end of 2027, with KASH price reaching **\$1.50**. Even as gold sales proceed, the value of remaining gold surges, causing reserve pool total assets to exceed **\$166M** by the end of 2028, with KASH rising to **\$1.66**.

Finally, when all 32,000 ounces of gold are completely liquidated by the end of 2029, about **\$171M** USDT will accumulate in the reserve pool, with each KASH token's value expected to be around **\$1.71**.

This represents **over 70% value appreciation** compared to the initial value, showing how a gold bull market brings significant benefits to KASH's collateral value.

### 2027-2030년 금 가격 시나리오별 전망과 KASH 가격 예측

전 세계 금 가격에 대한 향후 예측치를 참고하여 **중립적**, **공격적** 2가지 시나리오를 구성하였습니다. 

각 시나리오 마다 2027년 1월부터 2030년 1월까지의 **월별 금 시세**를 가정하고, 이에 따라 매달 청산되는 vRWA(Gold) 물량과 잔존 vRWA의 가치 변화를 계산하였습니다. 

또한 리저브풀에 축적되는 USDT와 총자산 가치의 월별 추이를 추산하고, 이를 **100M KASH** (발행량 1억 개)로 나눈 **KASH 토큰 가격**의 변화를 예측했습니다. 

아래에서는 세 가지 시나리오별로 금 시세 가정 근거와 결과를 정리하며, 월별 데이터를 표로 제시합니다.

### 중립적 시나리오 (금 가격 완만 상승)

#### ✅ 가정

금 가격이 완만하게 상승하는 중간 수준의 전망입니다. 몇몇 전문기관의 예상에 따르면 2027년 경 금값이 \$4,000대를 돌파하고, 2028~2029년에는 \$5,000에 근접할 수 있습니다. 

예를 들어 InvestingHaven은 2027년에 \$4,400까지 상승을 전망했으며, 유명 투자자 존 폴슨도 2028년까지 \$5,000 가까이 상승할 수 있다고 언급했습니다. Gov Capital 등의 예측치로 보면 2029년 말 \$5,200 이상도 가능하다는 시나리오입니다.

:::

#### ✅ 금 가격 시세

본 시나리오는 2027년 1월 \$3,250/oz 수준에서 시작하여 2027년 말 약 \$4,150, 2028년 말 \$4,750, 2029년 말 \$5,280까지 꾸준히 상승하는 경로로 설정했습니다. 

2030년 1월에는 약 \$5,400까지 약간 더 상승한 것으로 가정합니다. 이 증가는 중앙은행들의 지속적인 금 매입, 지정학적 불안에 따른 안전자산 수요 증가 등이 맞물려 금값이 완만한 우상향을 그리는 시나리오입니다.

#### 📘 시나리오 결과

금값 상승으로 vRWA 담보 가치가 크게 증가하여 리저브풀의 총가치가 시간이 갈수록 **초과담보** 상태를 보입니다. 

초기 2027년 1월 금가격 \$3,250일 때 리저브풀 가치 약 **\$104M** (담보 초과)로 KASH 당 **\$1.04**로 시작합니다. 금 매각을 진행하면서도 남은 금의 평가가치가 상승 폭이 커서, 2027년 말에는 리저브풀 총자산이 **\$127M**을 넘고 KASH 가격이 **\$1.27** 수준까지 올라갑니다. 

2028년에도 금값이 \$4천 중반에서 \$4천 후반대로 상승함에 따라 리저브풀 자산이 늘어나 KASH 가격은 **\$1.37** 내외가 됩니다. 

최종적으로 2029년 말 모든 금 청산 완료 시점에는 리저브풀에 약 **\$140M** 이상의 USDT가 확보되어 KASH 토큰 1개의 내재가치는 약 **\$1.40** 정도로 예상됩니다. 

즉, 금가격 상승분이 KASH 담보가치에 반영되어 KASH 역시 초기보다 **약 40% 가치 상승**을 보이게 됩니다.

### 공격적 시나리오 (금 가격 급등)

#### ✅ 가정

금 가격이 강세장을 맞아 급등하는 낙관적 전망입니다. JP모건 등 일부 기관은 2029년경 금값이 \$6,000까지 상승할 수 있다고 예상했으며 , 심지어 인플레이션이 극심할 경우 2030년까지 \$8,000 이상 폭등할 가능성도 제기됩니다. 

예컨대 Incrementum의 보고서는 2030년까지 금 가격이 **\$4,800 ~ \$8,900** 범위에서 움직일 수 있다고 전망하였습니다. 

본 시나리오는 이런 **최대치에 가까운 강세 국면**을 가정하여 금값이 가파르게 상승하는 상황을 반영합니다.

[Gold to reach $8,900 by 2029? A startling report says so — here's what investors should keep in mind](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/gold-to-reach-8900-by-2029-a-startling-report-says-so-heres-what-investors-should-keep-in-mind/articleshow/121414654.cms)

#### ✅ 금 가격 시세

2027년 1월 \$3,200/oz 수준에서 시작하나 곧 강세를 보여 2027년 말에는 **\$5,000**까지 급등, 2028년 말 **\$6,000**, 2029년 말 **\$7,000**까지 상승하는 경로로 설정했습니다. (JP모건의 2029년 \$6,000 전망보다 다소 공격적인 수치이나, 전체 금 투자 환경이 매우 호의적일 경우 가능한 시나리오입니다.) 

2030년 1월에는 \$7,200까지 상승한 것으로 가정했습니다. 이러한 경로는 중앙은행의 폭발적 매입 증가, 심각한 지정학적 위기나 통화가치 하락 등으로 투자자금이 금으로 대거 유입되는 **황금 강세장**을 상정한 것입니다.

#### 📘 시나리오 결과

금 가격 급등에 따라 담보로 보유한 vRWA(Gold)의 가치가 크게 상승하여 리저브풀 자산이 크게 불어납니다. 

초기 2027년 1월에 약 **\$102.4M** (KASH 당 \$1.024)에서 시작한 리저브풀 총가치는, 금값이 오르는 덕분에 2027년 말에는 **\$150M**을 돌파하여 KASH 가격이 **\$1.50** 수준에 도달합니다. 이후 금 매각이 진행되면서도 남은 금의 가치가 폭증하여 2028년 말에는 리저브풀 총자산이 **\$166M** 이상, KASH 당 **\$1.66**으로 상승합니다. 

최종적으로 2029년 말에 금 32,000온스 전량을 청산 완료하면 리저브풀에 약 **\$1.71억** USDT가 축적되고, KASH 토큰 1개의 가치는 **\$1.71** 정도로 예상됩니다. 

이는 초기 대비 **약 70% 이상의 가치 상승**으로, 금 강세장이 KASH 담보가치에 큰 이익을 가져다주는 모습입니다.
